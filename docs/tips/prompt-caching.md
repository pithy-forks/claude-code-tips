# prompt caching

the single biggest cost lever in claude code. my overall cache hit rate is 95%. here's why.

## how it works

claude code caches your system prompt, tool definitions, and CLAUDE.md as a prefix. when these stay the same across turns, 90% of input tokens hit the cache, meaning you pay 1/10th the cost on those tokens.

## the trick

keep your CLAUDE.md **short and stable**. every edit breaks the prefix cache for that session.

```markdown
# my-project

## structure
- src/ -- application code
- tests/ -- test files

## conventions
- typescript strict mode
- vitest for testing
- never use `any`
```

that's it. 10-20 lines. project structure, conventions, hard rules. no prose, no philosophy.

## what kills your cache

- editing CLAUDE.md mid-session (cache invalidated immediately)
- very long CLAUDE.md files (more content = more to re-cache on changes)
- switching models mid-session (different cache prefix)

## real numbers

from real session data:

| session length | cache hit rate | avg cost |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| <10 min | 83% | $1.96 |
| 10-30 min | 91% | $5.59 |
| 30-60 min | 95% | $10.92 |
| 1-2 hr | 96% | $16.74 |
| 2 hr+ | 96% | $27.72 |

longer sessions cache better bc the prefix stabilizes and cache_write amortizes over more turns. short sessions spend proportionally more on initial cache creation.

## try it

1. check your current CLAUDE.md. is it under 30 lines?
2. move anything that changes frequently (task lists, WIP notes) to a separate file
3. run `/mine` to check your cache hit rate after a few sessions
